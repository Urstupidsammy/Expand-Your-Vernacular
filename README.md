# Expand-Your-Vernacular

## Description
In this project we collaborated to create a website that allows users a unique experience in learning new words. A user is able to click the generate button and will provided a random word and its definition. The user then can choose to click the generate button and be provided another word and definition. The simple yet responsive design of the website is stream-lined for use on various screen sizes.
